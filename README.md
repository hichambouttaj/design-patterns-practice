## Introduction


In software engineering, design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that developers encounter while designing software. These patterns provide a template for solving certain types of problems and help maintain clean, structured, and efficient code.

This repository aims to:

- Provide code examples and explanations for various design patterns.
- Demonstrate how to implement these patterns in java.
- Serve as a reference for developers interested in learning and applying design patterns.

## Design Patterns

Currently, this repository covers the following design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns**
    - [x] Singleton
    - [x] Prototype
    - [x] Builder
    - [x] Factory Method
    - [x] Abstract Factory
    - [ ] Object Pool

2. **Structural Patterns**
    - [x] Proxy
    - [x] Decorator
    - [x] Adapter
    - [x] Facade
    - [ ] Flyweight
    - [ ] Bridge
    - [ ] Composite

3. **Behavioral Patterns**
    - [ ] Chain of Responsibility
    - [ ] Interpreter
    - [ ] Iterator
    - [ ] Command
    - [ ] State
    - [ ] Template Method
    - [ ] Mediator
    - [ ] Memento
    - [ ] Visitor
    - [ ] Strategy
    - [ ] Observer

Each design pattern has its own directory within the repository, containing code examples, explanations.

## Getting Started

To explore the code examples for each design pattern, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hichambouttaj/design-patterns-practice.git
```

2. Navigate to the specific design pattern directory you're interested in.
3. Review the code, explanations of that pattern's directory.

Feel free to contribute by adding more design patterns, improving existing code examples, or suggesting enhancements.
